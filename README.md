# Codedex Practice for My Data Field Journey (Data Science & Data Analysis) - 2026 ✮⋆˙
I'm triving to be a Data Analyst, because I always enjoy working with data. I like playing game and I want to learning code for my data career, so Codedex is my new favorit place to learn. The concept of getting exp everytime I finished a chapter of course is just giving me ambition to make me wanna get more... 
More study means more exp, so satisfaction and lesson learned at the same time (kill two birds with one stone hahah ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧)
